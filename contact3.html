    <p>Up in the northern suburbs, Evanston Chicken Shack has been frying terrific breasts, thighs, legs, and wings for nearly three decades. A simple salt-and-pepper breading gives the bird its distinct flavor, and wallet-friendly lunch box specials offer chicken and sides for under $9.</p>

<p>Chef Paul Fehribach uses a classic Edna Lewis recipe for his excellent version, brining Amish chicken in herbs and spices and then frying it in leaf lard, ham drippings, and clarified butter.</p>

<p>What started out as a food truck has now blossomed into four brick-and-mortar locations. Chef and owner Joe Scroggs, who hails from North Carolina, serves two types of poultry. The first is Nashville-style hot chicken, slathered with cayenne paste, that has a hint of sweetness and lots of spice. The second is a milder herb-seasoned chicken. Either can also be eaten in sandwich form on a brioche roll or fluffy biscuit.</p>

<p>Ms. T’s owner Tia Tanner previously operated a Harold’s outpost before breaking off and opening a restaurant in Lakeview. Her experience with the beloved Chicago chain is apparent after biting into the fried chicken. The cooked-to-order meat is juicy, the skin is crispy, and it’s decidedly better when doused in mild sauce.</p>

<p>The popular Avondale spot was conceived after a series of pop-up dinners led to a cult following for its honey-butter-covered bird. Christine Cikowski and Joshua Kulp rode that momentum and launched a restaurant dedicated to the sweet-and-savory specialty in 2013. Since then, they’ve put the bird on everything from nachos to sandwiches, but the deboned fried chicken still remains a favorite.</p>
