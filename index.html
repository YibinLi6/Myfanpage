    <p>Southern fried chicken, also known simply as fried chicken</p>
    <p>is a dish consisting of chicken pieces which have been coated in a seasoned batter and pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried.</p>
    <p>The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat.</p>
    <p>Broiler chickens are most commonly used.</p>
    <p>The first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the European Middle Ages. </p>
    <p> However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning).</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had traditions of seasoned fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil).</p>
    <p>Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South.</p>
